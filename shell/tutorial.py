- Submit hourly data through a form at /hourly-form.
- Submit daily summaries through a form at /daily-form.
- View recent submissions using the /api/recent-hourly endpoint.
- Manage exported files, generated in the exports/intermediate directory.

To access the web app:
1. Start the app using 'run_webapp' in the shell or run_webapp.ps1.
2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

Batch scripts in the batch/ directory allow you to automate tasks. 
For example:
- Spoof data entries at specific times.
- List or clear export directories after completing workflows.

To execute a batch script:
1. Create a batch script using 'generate_sample_batch.ps1' or manually.
2. Run it using the 'batch' command in the shell.

Example:
batch afternoon_workflow.txt
